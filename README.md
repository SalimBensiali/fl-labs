Sample use cases for PTV FeatureLayer, run it on http://ptv-logistics.github.io/fl-labs/ 

To use this code, you need an installed PTV xRoute/xLocate/xMap or an xServer internet subscription. Go to http://xserver.ptvgroup.com/en-uk/products/ptv-xserver-internet/test/ to get a trial token.

This is also the base for some more advanced samples, e.g. "Feature-Layer Labs" http://ptv-logistics.github.io/fl-labs/.
